Welcome to the SOA-NBP documentation!

Stochastic Optoacoustic Numerical Breast Phantom (**SOA-NBP**) is a software framework to stochastically generate three-dimensional (3D) distributions of the *functional*, *optical*, and *acousitc properties* of breasts and lesions for use in computational studies of **optical**, **acoustic**, and **optoacoustic (OA) imaging**, also known as **photoacoustic imaging**. The functional, optical, and acoustic numerical breast phatnoms (NBPs) are seperately established via assignmnet of the specific properties of breasts to each tissue type in the anatomical NBPs.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
